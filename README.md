# 🐍 Snake game built with Vue

📚 Just for learning purposes.

This is my first project wih Vue, so there will be a lot of code
that can be done more efficiently. Please, feel free to create any 
pull request you want 🙂

# Road Map

- [ ] Add tests for the components
- [ ] Add score board with local storage
- [ ] Add Webpack, postCSS or whatever it's needed to add Tailwind
- [ ] Center the board properly
